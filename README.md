# Elm version of Angular's popular heroes
If you have done the Angular IO [Tour of Heroes|https://angular.io/tutorial] exercise you will be familiar with this example that replicates in Elm the first 4 steps or so of that tutorial.

This beginner's example is designed to run with Elm Reactor and just scratches the surface of working with Elm.

## Getting Started
It shouldn't take much to get going on this project.

1. [Install Elm|https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html] on your local machine.

2. Clone this repository. If you're unfamiliar with this process, you can just copy and paste the contents of the files into files of the same name and with the same data structure on your machine.

3. Using your terminal program, from the /src/ directory, run `elm reactor`.

4. Visit the website. It should default to 0.0.0.0/8000 and your system should give you a url to go to when Elm Reactor spins up.

If you have trouble, feel free to submit an issue. I will probably actively watch those through October 2019 and attempt to respond in a reasonable amount of time.
